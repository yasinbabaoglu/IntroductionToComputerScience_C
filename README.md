## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or any IDE that supports C programming (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, CLion).
- Basic knowledge of C programming language, including syntax, data types, loops, and functions.

### Running the Programs

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yasinbabaoglu/IntroductionToComputerScience_C.git
   cd IntroductionToComputerScience_C
   

2. Compile and run any of the C programs using GCC or any other C compiler:

   bash
   gcc -o program_name file_name.c
   ./program_name
   

   Replace file_name.c with the name of the C file you wish to compile, and program_name with the desired executable name.
